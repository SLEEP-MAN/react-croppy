## Why?

 - Uses an `<img>` for semantic markup.
 - Maintains image aspect ratio at all times.
 - Ensures images are centered.

## Install

```sh
npm install react-croppy --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Image } from 'react-croppy';

const App = () => {
    const crop = {
        x      : 10,
        y      : 10,
        width  : 40,
        height : 40
    };
    return <Image src="/cute-puppy.png" crop={crop} alt="A cute puppy">
};
```

## API

### `<Image>`

React component that renders an image using an [`<img>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element. You may optionally pass a `crop` object as a prop to control which part of the image is displayed.
